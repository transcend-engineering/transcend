                  <li>However, final submissions will be evaluated based on five main criteria:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Idea—novelty, creativity, importance</li>
                      <li>Prototype<a href="#footnotes"><sup>3</sup></a>—implementing your idea in the real world</li>
                      <li>Business Model—how your idea fits a market (product-market fit). Keys to promoting your idea as a business: customer segment, value proposition, channels, cost structure, etc. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoAOzMTLP5s">this video</a> for a great place to start</li>
                      <li>Execution—the most important factor. Hustle, effort, and taking the meaningful steps to grow an idea are all <em>crucial</em></li>
                      <li>Pitch—sell us on your idea. There is an award for <em>Fan Favorite</em>!</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Teams may include up to 5 participants.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
                  <li>After final submissions are made, all group members are required to attend their assigned pitch time-slot.

                  <li>For those competing with class projects, all group members must have to option to compete together with said idea. Permission to compete with said idea must be a <em>unanimous</em> decision, regardless of if each individual member decides to compete.</li>
                  <li>Pitches will be broken up into two days, March 29<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup>.  The pitching order is assigned based on availability and not by quality of submission.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol class="footnotes sectionText" id="footnotes">
                  <li>Students graduating in the fall semester are still eligible to compete.</li>
                  <li>All U.S. Citizens will be required to submit a <em>W-9</em> form with their final application in the spring. All resident aliens and non-resident aliens will be asked to present their <em>I-20</em>, most recent <em>I-94</em>, <em>Passport with photo and Homeland Security stamp</em>, <em>SEVIS</em>, and <em>W-8BEN</em> (subject to change). These requirements allow you to receive your awards faster!</li>
                  <li>Prototypes are <em>not</em> required. For those competing with prototypes, there will be designated times for demonstration.
                  Prototypes <em>do not need</em> to be final or working prototypes. Prototypes simply display your effort to implement your idea in reality and demonstrate its feasibility. Prototypes do not need to be physical: mockups, renderings, CAD models, wireframes or 3D prints are all valid. Think <em>minimum viable product first</em>.</li>
                  <li>Special exceptions may be made for in class projects to protect the intellectual contribution of group members. If you think this may be the case, please email transcenduw@gmail.com</li>
