                    Transcend is dedicated to empowering students with hustle. We strive to support students, financially and otherwise, with their endeavors,
                    regardless if they fit the University’s curricula. Students should feel that their individual, entrepreneurial efforts
                    do not subtract from their education, but rather bolster it. This scholarship is to support and encourage students that are following their
                    entrepreneurial passions, by easing the financial burden of entrepreneurship.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The most deserving candidate will embrace the values which Transcend strives to represent.
                    He or she will be a self-starter, someone who takes advantage of the rich resources of the entrepreneurship
                     community and offers his or her knowledge or skill set to support others when the opportunity arises.
